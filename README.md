"Company everywhere face the same crisis: failing legacy systems, no RPG experts, lost business knowledge"

"The usual options? Expensive, slow, or risky. But what if we could evolve instead?"

"Evolution that preserves your business DNA while creating modern, maintainable systems."

"Introducing RPGEvolver - where legacy code doesn't die, it evolves."

let me demonstrate exactly how RPGEvolver makes this transformation possible."I've logged into our Adjudication Services evolution portal
"The first step is to provide our legacy RPG source code. Now we need to specify two critical pieces of information:
Target Language and RPG Type: This determines how the AI analyzes the code structure

"With our configuration complete, I'll now click the 'Evolve RPG Code' button to begin the transformation.
Watch the magic happen! RPGEvolver immediately starts its sophisticated multi-step evolution process.
Five AI engines analyze, extract, document, and generate your modern application.

Each stage builds upon the previous ones, creating a seamless evolution pipeline. This is what makes RPGEvolver unique - it doesn't just convert code, it evolves the entire system's DNA.

The process is now complete! the system has generated multiple artifacts, all available for download .

An important feature of our solution is that it doesn't just automate - it augments human expertise. Before proceeding to the next stage, our business SMEs have an opportunity to review and refine these artifacts.

"Now comes the truly revolutionary part of the RPGEvolver ecosystem.Get complete artifacts: pseudocode, flow diagrams, business documentation, and Python structure. Feed into Cursor AI for vibe coding and  complete applications in hours.

Coming soon: RPGEvolver MCP server - direct Cursor AI integration, no manual steps!
