"Company everywhere face the same crisis: failing legacy systems, no RPG experts, lost business knowledge"

"The usual options? Expensive, slow, or risky. But what if we could evolve instead?"

"Evolution that preserves your business DNA while creating modern, maintainable systems."

"Introducing RPGEvolver - where legacy code doesn't die, it evolves."

let me demonstrate exactly how RPGEvolver makes this transformation possible."I've logged into our Adjudication Services evolution portal
"The first step is to provide our legacy RPG source code. Now we need to specify two critical pieces of information:
Target Language and RPG Type: This determines how the AI analyzes the code structure

"With our configuration complete, I'll now click the 'Evolve RPG Code' button to begin the transformation.
Watch the magic happen! RPGEvolver immediately starts its sophisticated multi-step evolution process.
Five AI engines analyze, extract, document, and generate your modern application.

Each stage builds upon the previous ones, creating a seamless evolution pipeline. This is what makes RPGEvolver unique - it doesn't just convert code, it evolves the entire system's DNA.


The process is now complete! the system has generated multiple artifacts, all available for download .
"Get complete artifacts: pseudocode, flow diagrams, business documentation, and Python structure
et's examine what we've received by opening the folder.
Inside, we find:

pseudocode.txt: A complete representation of the business logic in a language-agnostic format
flow_diagram.md: Mermaid diagrams visualizing the application's process flow
business_document.md: Comprehensive documentation of business rules and functionality

An important feature of our solution is that it doesn't just automate - it augments human expertise. Before proceeding to the next stage, our business SMEs have an opportunity to review and refine these artifacts.

"Now comes the truly revolutionary part of the RPGEvolver ecosystem.Get complete artifacts: pseudocode, flow diagrams, business documentation, and Python structure. I've created a new project folder and imported all our evolution artifacts. Now I'll engage Cursor AI with this prompt:Feed into Cursor AI for vibe coding and  complete applications in hours.

Coming soon: RPGEvolver MCP server - direct Cursor AI integration, no manual steps!
 
"Ready to evolve your legacy systems?"


"Meet RPGEvolver AI Agent - our intelligent MCP server that transforms any development environment into an autonomous modernization powerhouse. Now integrated with Cursor AI, VS Code, and any MCP-compatible client."

"Three breakthrough tools eliminate manual work entirely. Tool 1: rpg_conversion_workflow - One command orchestrates the entire conversion pipeline. No more managing multiple steps."

"Tool 2: modernize_rpg_code - Our core AI engine that analyzes RPG structure, extracts business logic, generates Python code, creates documentation, and builds flow diagrams - all powered by Azure OpenAI GPT-4."


"Tool 3: get_python_conversion_prompt - Provides Cursor AI with intelligent next-step instructions, eliminating guesswork and vibe coding. The AI tells developers exactly what to do next."

"Watch this transformation: Legacy RPG becomes production-ready Python in under 2 minutes. Complete with enterprise-grade documentation, architectural diagrams, and deployment-ready code. Zero manual intervention required."
