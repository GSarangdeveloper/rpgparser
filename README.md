Hi everyone, and welcome! Today, I'm thrilled to show you how our FigmaDev Accelerator can revolutionize your design-to-code workflow, transforming Figma designs into functional Angular applications with incredible speed and accuracy, powered by AI. Let's dive in!

Part 1: Extracting Design Intelligence from Figma
Voiceover: Okay, here we are in Figma.

Voiceover: I have this "Product Showcase" component designed with Auto Layout, using our company's approved styles and design tokens. Manually coding this would take a significant amount of time, ensuring every pixel and style is perfect.

Voiceover: Now, watch this. I'm going to select the entire component here...

Voiceover: ...and now, I'll open our FigmaDev Accelerator plugin. You can find it right here under "Plugins," then "Development."

Voiceover: As you can see, the plugin gives us several options. We could extract just the HTML, the CSS, specific component information, or layout details. But for our full AI-powered workflow, we're going to select the "Complete Package for AI" option.

Voiceover: And just like that! The plugin has meticulously analyzed the selected Figma component and extracted everything – the structure, all the approved CSS styling, design tokens like colors and typography, layout specifications, and even component variant information. It's all bundled into this comprehensive JSON package.

Voiceover: Perfect. Now, I'll just copy this entire JSON package to my clipboard.

Voiceover: And that's Part 1! We've successfully bridged the gap between design and data, capturing the complete design DNA.

Part 2: Setting the Stage in Cursor AI
Voiceover: Alright, now for the exciting part – let's bring this design to life with Cursor AI.

Voiceover: I'm going to create a new project workspace here in Cursor for our Angular application. Let's call it "ProductShowcaseApp."

Voiceover: Now, the first crucial step is to give Cursor AI the rich context from our Figma design. I'll create a new file, maybe call it figma-design-elements.json, and paste the JSON data we copied from our plugin.

Voiceover: This file now contains all the specific styling, layout, and token information from our Figma design, directly accessible to Cursor AI. This is the foundation that ensures our AI-generated UI will actually match our design intent.

Voiceover: Next, let's define what we want this component to do. I have a simple user story prepared: "As a user, I want to see a product card that displays the product image, name, price, and an 'Add to Cart' button. The button should have a distinct hover state."

Voiceover: So, we have our precise design elements from Figma and our functional requirements in the form of a user story.

Part 3: Prompting Cursor AI for Angular Development
Voiceover: Now, let's instruct Cursor AI to build our Angular application. I'll open a chat or prompt window with Cursor.

Voiceover: And here’s the magic. I'll give it a prompt like this:

Voiceover: "Okay, Cursor, utilizing the design elements found in figma-design-elements.json and the following user story: '[Paste or re-type the user story here]', please build an Angular application. Create a new component for the product showcase. Ensure the component uses the styles, colors, and layout information provided in the Figma design elements. The 'Add to Cart' button should have a hover effect as defined."

Voiceover: We're explicitly telling Cursor to use our extracted Figma data as the source of truth for the visual design, and the user story for the functionality. Let's send that off!

Part 4: The Result - Angular Application Up and Running!
Voiceover: And here we go! Cursor AI is now processing our request, using the detailed Figma design data and the user story to generate the Angular component structure, HTML template, and SCSS/CSS styles.

Voiceover: Look at that – it's creating the component TypeScript file, the HTML template using the structural hints from our Figma data, and the stylesheet applying those exact design tokens and layout properties.

Voiceover: Once it's done, we'll just need to ensure our main app module imports and declares this new component, and then we can serve the application.

Voiceover: And... voila! Our Angular application is up and running!

Voiceover: As you can see, the product card is rendered beautifully, perfectly matching our Figma design – the colors, the fonts, the spacing, the layout. And the 'Add to Cart' button has that hover effect we specified. All of this, generated in a fraction of the time it would take to code manually.

Voiceover: That’s the power of the FigmaDev Accelerator combined with Cursor AI: precise design extraction providing a solid foundation for intelligent, AI-driven UI development. Thanks for watching!
