# RPG Modernization Assistant: Voice Demo Script

## Introduction

"Welcome to our demonstration of the RPG Modernization Assistant Tool, an AI-powered solution designed to transform legacy RPG code into modern Java or Python applications. This innovative tool leverages multi-LLM processing to extract business logic, generate documentation, and create a foundation for modern development. Let me walk you through the entire workflow."

## Portal Login & Tool Selection

"As you can see, I've logged into our enterprise modernization portal. This central hub provides access to various tools designed to accelerate our digital transformation initiatives.

On the left sidebar, you'll notice the 'RPG Modernization Assistant' option. Let me select that now to access the tool's interface.

The modernization assistant opens in a clean, intuitive workspace designed to simplify the complex process of legacy code transformation."

## File Upload & Configuration

"The first step is to provide our legacy RPG source code. You can see we have multiple options for this:
- Drag and drop directly into the highlighted area
- Browse your local file system
- Select from recently used files

For this demonstration, I'll upload a customer maintenance program written in RPG that has been exported as a text file. This particular program has been managing customer records for over 15 years and contains critical business logic our organization relies on.

Now we need to specify two critical pieces of information:

1. **RPG Type**: This determines how the AI analyzes the code structure
   - 'Synon Generated' - For code created using CASE tools like Synon/2E
   - 'Modern RPG' - For hand-written, typically free-format RPGLE

This sample is Synon-generated code, so I'll select that option.

2. **Target Language**: This determines the output technology stack
   - 'Java (Spring Boot)' - Enterprise-grade Java application structure
   - 'Python' - Flexible, modern Python application structure

For this demonstration, I'll select Java as our target language, since our development team has standardized on a Spring Boot microservices architecture."

## Processing Initiation

"With our configuration complete, I'll now click the 'Process RPG Code' button to begin the transformation.

The system immediately starts a sophisticated multi-step process. Notice how the interface provides real-time progress updates as each specialized LLM call is initiated:

1. **Connection Verification**: The system confirms connectivity with our secure LLM provider
2. **Source Analysis**: The first LLM call analyzes the RPG structure and patterns
3. **Pseudocode Generation**: The second LLM call extracts business logic into language-agnostic pseudocode
4. **Flow Diagram Creation**: The third LLM call generates visual process flows using Mermaid syntax
5. **Business Documentation**: The fourth LLM call produces comprehensive business documentation
6. **Target Code Structure**: The fifth LLM call generates the target application skeleton
7. **Logic Implementation**: The final LLM call translates the pseudocode into the target language

You can see that each stage builds upon the previous ones, creating a seamless transformation pipeline. This approach ensures we preserve the business logic while enabling a modern implementation."

## Results & Artifacts

"The process is now complete! As you can see, the system has generated multiple artifacts, all available for download as a single package or individually.

Let me click 'Download All Artifacts' to retrieve the complete transformation package.

The download is now complete. Let's examine what we've received by opening the folder.

Inside, we find:
1. **pseudocode.txt**: A complete representation of the business logic in a language-agnostic format
2. **flow_diagram.md**: Mermaid diagrams visualizing the application's process flow
3. **business_document.md**: Comprehensive documentation of business rules and functionality
4. **src/**: Complete Java application structure with Spring Boot configuration
5. **pom.xml**: Maven build configuration

What makes these artifacts particularly valuable is that they serve as both documentation and a foundation for development. Notice how the business rules are clearly documented, with each artifact providing a different perspective on the same underlying logic."

## Manual Review & Refinement

"An important feature of our solution is that it doesn't just automate - it augments human expertise. Before proceeding to the next stage, our business SMEs have an opportunity to review and refine these artifacts.

For example, a domain expert might:
- Clarify business rules in the documentation
- Enhance the pseudocode with additional context
- Adjust entity relationships in the model
- Refine API definitions in the controller classes

This human-in-the-loop approach ensures that institutional knowledge is incorporated and any AI-generated assumptions are validated. For this demonstration, our SMEs have already reviewed the artifacts and made necessary adjustments."

## Integration with Cursor AI

"Now comes the truly transformative part of our solution. Rather than treating these artifacts as static documentation, we'll use them as intelligent building blocks for rapid implementation using Cursor AI.

I've created a new project folder and imported all our artifacts. Now I'll engage Cursor AI with a simple prompt:

'Build a complete Java Spring Boot application based on the pseudocode, flow diagrams, and business documentation provided in this project. Follow our enterprise coding standards and implement all functionality described in the business document.'

Watch as Cursor AI analyzes all the artifacts in context and begins implementing the complete application:
- It's creating controller methods based on the flow diagrams
- Implementing service layer logic from the pseudocode
- Building data models derived from the business document
- Adding validation rules based on business requirements
- Generating unit tests to ensure functionality

The AI doesn't just blindly generate code - it's having a conversation with our developers, asking clarifying questions, and adapting to feedback. This collaboration between human expertise and AI acceleration is what makes our approach uniquely powerful."

## Quality Assurance Through CI/CD

"As the implementation nears completion, we'll verify that everything meets our enterprise standards through our CI/CD pipeline.

I'm triggering our Jenkins pipeline now, which will:
1. Compile the application
2. Run Checkmarx security scans
3. Execute SonarQube quality analysis
4. Run automated tests
5. Generate quality reports

This ensures that our modernized application not only preserves business functionality but also adheres to modern security and quality standards. The scan results show excellent compliance with our enterprise guidelines."

## Conclusion

"And there you have it - a complete transformation from legacy RPG to a modern, maintainable Spring Boot application. What traditionally would have taken months of tedious manual work has been accelerated to days, with higher quality and more comprehensive documentation.

The key advantages of our approach include:
- Preservation of critical business logic
- Significant reduction in modernization time and cost
- Decreased dependency on scarce RPG expertise
- Higher quality, more maintainable output
- Comprehensive documentation of business rules

This demonstration has showcased how our RPG Modernization Assistant, combined with Cursor AI, creates a powerful end-to-end solution for legacy modernization that preserves your business knowledge while enabling digital transformation."
