RmodernizeX: AI-Powered RPG Modernization(Date: May 14, 2025)1. Initiative/Idea:RmodernizeX: An innovative, AI-driven tool designed to significantly accelerate the modernization of our legacy RPG applications into modern Java/Python architectures. It automates critical analysis, documentation, and initial code generation steps.2. Brief Summary of Problem Statement:Modernizing our extensive RPG codebase is crucial for agility, talent acquisition, and integration, but traditional manual approaches are slow, costly, resource-intensive (requiring scarce RPG expertise), and carry significant risk of errors and knowledge loss. This creates a bottleneck for strategic business initiatives.3. Value Proposition:Accelerated Modernization: Drastically reduce project timelines by automating foundational analysis and code drafting.Reduced Cost & Risk: Lower manual effort, minimize errors in translation, and improve consistency.Enhanced Code Quality & Security: Generate comprehensive documentation and integrate with CI/CD quality gates (SonarQube, Checkmarx) from the outset.Empowered Developers: Provide developers (using tools like Cursor AI) with rich contextual understanding (pseudocode, flow diagrams, business logic docs) and a strong starting point for refinement, allowing them to focus on high-value tasks.Knowledge Preservation: Capture and translate embedded business logic before RPG expertise diminishes further.4. Status:Proof of Concept Developed: The core "RmodernizeX" Python tool is functional, successfully demonstrating the automated generation of:Parsed Code AnalysisPseudocodeFlow Diagrams (Mermaid)Initial Business Logic DocumentationDraft Target Architecture Code (Java/Python)Next Steps: Pilot on a representative application suite to quantify benefits and refine the tool for broader rollout.
