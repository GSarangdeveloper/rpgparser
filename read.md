Here's an updated demo script for UI Genie with the doodle-style introduction and enhanced ending:

[0:00-0:20] Doodle Animation Sequence:
[Animation: Simple hand-drawn character "Jane" appears]
"Meet Jane, a frontend developer facing the daily grind of manual UI development..."
[Doodle animations showing:]

"Manual style inspection" - Jane squinting at designs with a magnifying glass
"Repetitive coding from scratch" - Jane typing the same code over and over
"Multiple refinement cycles" - Jane going in circles with revisions
"Slow delivery timelines" - Clock ticking, calendar pages flipping, frustrated Jane

"Sound familiar? Here comes the solution..."

[0:20-0:30] Solution Introduction:
"Introducing UI Genie - every engineer's favorite AI companion that transforms wireframes into production-ready code in minutes!"

[0:30-0:40] Tool Overview:
"From the RxClaim Innovation Lab, UI Genie follows a simple three-step process that revolutionizes your UI development workflow."

[0:40-0:55] Step One:
"Step one: Upload any UI design image. Our GPT-4 vision analyzes every detail - colors, spacing, typography, and layout structure with pixel-perfect precision."

[0:55-1:05] User Stories:
"The AI then generates comprehensive user stories, capturing functional requirements like 'As a customer, I want to view my order summary' - ensuring we build with user needs in mind."

[1:05-1:15] Step Two:
"Step two provides direct Figma integration. Simply paste your Figma URL, and we extract exact measurements, component hierarchy, and responsive constraints - no manual copying needed."

[1:15-1:25] Step Three:
"Step three is where the magic happens. Our code generation engine creates complete Angular components - TypeScript, HTML, and SCSS - with built-in refinements for production-ready quality."

[1:25-1:45] Enhanced Workflow Integration:
"Download your generated artifacts and import them directly into Cursor AI. With Digital Pulse integration and vibe coding, the context flows seamlessly from UI Genie..."
